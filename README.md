# scale-the-heights
* This is a program made in Raylib C++. It is a small, fun game made in C++.
* The Player is a man on a pogo stick.
* The Player can move left and right, and also jump.
* The Player spawns next to many Jumping Platforms, that spawn vertically, and are solid, meaning the player can stand on them.
* The Player has to jump on top of the Jumping Platforms.
* After about twenty Jumping Platforms, twenty Walking Platforms spawn.
* The Walking Platforms are at the same elevation i.e. the Y value is same, but X is different, but the Player has to jump across the gap to stand on the Walking platforms.
* After about twenty Walking Platforms, more Jumping Platforms spawn, and so on.
* Every fifth Platform, regardless of type, spawns with a Powerup, which increases the Player's score.
* The Game also comes with a pause and play button.
* As the Player moves on top of the Platforms, the X and Y value of the Player increase, and is shown in the top left of the window.
* As the Player collects Powerups, the score also increases and is shown in the top left of the window.
* The Player has to be careful not to jump into the gaps between the Platforms, and if he does, then the game is over, and all stats will be reset.
* The highest X and Y value, highest score, and number of games played are shown in the title screen after playing at least one game.
* The controls for the Game are:
  - Move left: Key A
  - Move right: Key D
  - Jump: Key Space
* The camera tracks the Player's position.
* The Player's goal is to climb as many Platforms as possible, avoid the gaps, and collect as many Powerups as possible.
* There is a builtin release of the game, which contains all fonts, textures, and sounds built in to the executable.
* I hope all players have as much fun playing my game, just as how much fun I had designing it. ðŸ˜‰
